## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an **aspiring Software Development Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms, backend development, and system design**, driven by a deep curiosity about how **large-scale systems operate beneath the abstractions**. I enjoy exploring how data flows through systems, how failures emerge in real-world environments, and how **resilient, scalable software** is designed to handle those challenges gracefully.

With **1000+ problems solved on LeetCode**, I have developed disciplined problem-solving habits and a strong ability to write **efficient, predictable, and scalable code**. My primary language for DSA is **Java**, and I am comfortable translating theoretical concepts into **practical, production-oriented solutions**. This journey has strengthened my understanding of **time–space tradeoffs, algorithmic optimizations, and clean code principles**.

## 🧠 Core Computer Science Fundamentals

I have a solid grasp of core CS concepts, including:

- **Operating Systems**  
  Processes, threads, memory management, concurrency

- **Computer Networks**  
  HTTP, TCP/IP, latency, reliability

- **Databases**  
  Relational concepts, indexing, transactions

- **Distributed Systems**  
  Scalability, fault tolerance, consistency models

## 🔐 Interests Beyond Software Engineering

Beyond traditional software engineering, I have a growing interest in **cybersecurity and system reliability**. I enjoy thinking from both the **builder’s and breaker’s perspective**—analyzing edge cases, identifying failure modes, and understanding security vulnerabilities that are often overlooked in surface-level implementations.

This mindset helps me design systems that are not only functional, but also **robust, secure, and production-ready**.

## 🧩 Engineering Philosophy

- Clean architecture over quick hacks  
- Correctness and predictability over shortcuts  
- Strong fundamentals before frameworks  
- Long-term maintainability over temporary fixes  

I believe great software is built through **thoughtful design, deep understanding, and engineering discipline**.
